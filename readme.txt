--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

* I included multiple HTML pages (Home, About, Projects, Resume, and Contact) with clear navigation between them.
* The pages use proper headings and paragraph text to organize content. 
* I also included images with descriptive alt text and links to external sites such as LinkedIn and GitHub.


(b) CSS features

* I used CSS to control spacing, margins, and alignment to make the layout clean and readable.
* I applied consistent colors and typography across all pages and used a custom font to improve the overall look of the site.
* The layout adjusts using CSS to stay readable on different screen sizes.


(c) Advanced features

* I implemented a more complex page layout by using a persistent sidebar navigation menu that appears across pages. 
* The site is fully responsive and adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes using CSS layout techniques.



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

I did not ignore any errors or likely problems.
I fixed everything until all pages showed 0 Known Problems and 0 Likely Problems in AChecker. 
The only messages left were Potential Problems, which need manual review.

--> The most common potential warnings were:

* Image alt text warnings: The checker flagged images even though all images already have clear and descriptive alt text and do not contain important text.

* Text direction warnings: These appeared even though the entire site is written in English and does not switch languages or text direction.

* Heading usage warnings: Some headings were flagged as possibly being used for styling, but they are actually used to organize and structure the content on each page.

* Navigation and link grouping warnings: The checker warned that link groups might not be marked, but the navigation menu is consistent and clearly labeled on every page.

* Skip link and sitemap warnings: These were flagged because the site does not include a skip link or sitemap. Since the portfolio is small and easy to navigate, this does not cause real accessibility issues.

* Language identification warnings: AChecker warned that some words might not be identified as English, even though the document language is already set to English.

After reviewing these manually, I decided they do not negatively affect accessibility for this project. 
Because they were only potential warnings and repeated across pages, I explained them instead of changing the site structure unnecessarily.

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

It took me approximately 12–15 hours to complete this assignment.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

I used a mix of design inspiration websites, validation tools, and AI assistance while working on this assignment. 
For visual inspiration, I browsed Pinterest and looked at sample portfolio websites to understand how personal portfolios are commonly structured.
I also used the Sherwin-Williams sample site to help guide my color palette.
To check correctness and formatting, I used several W3C tools, including the W3C HTML Validator, the W3C CSS Validator, and the AChecker accessibility validator.
I also used ChatGPT as a coding and support tool during the assignment. ChatGPT helped generate and revise portions of the HTML and CSS, suggested solutions for layout and responsiveness.
I reviewed, edited, and integrated this code into my project to match the assignment requirements and my own design choices.

Specific resources used:

1. Pinterest (design inspiration)

2. https://samples.sherwin-williams.com/

3. https://www.portfoliobox.com/examples

4. https://validator.w3.org/

5. https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

6. https://achecks.org/checker/index.php

7. ChatGPT (Update: I used it to help me with my code as well regarding styling & placement of things in my main pages)


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I asked two friends to show me their portfolio designs so I could get inspiration for layout and styling ideas.

7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code? 

No. The site runs by opening index.html in a browser.
