<div class="about-text">
  <p>
    I am a Software Engineering student at UC Irvine with a strong interest in how modern
    software systems are built, scaled, and maintained. I am especially drawn to areas
    like cloud development and DevOps because they shape how technology actually reaches
    people in reliable and meaningful ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    I find today’s software tools fascinating. The ability to build, deploy, and improve
    systems continuously has changed how we think about technology, collaboration, and
    problem solving. Being able to work with these tools feels both powerful and exciting,
    and it motivates me to keep learning and exploring what is possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy learning new technologies as projects demand and adapting to new environments
    along the way. I care about writing code that is clear and thoughtful, but I also think
    about how systems behave over time, how dependable they are, and how they grow as
    needs change.
  </p>

  <p>
    What excites me most about software engineering is that it is never finished. There
    is always something new to learn, refine, or improve, and I enjoy being part of a
    field that is constantly evolving alongside the people who use it.
